### Chris Jenkin
My name is Chris and in this project i worked on Enemys and Enemy AI.

In this Project i contributed by creating the enemys and the enemy AI and making them have the proper animations for death, attack and walking. I also created a patrol for the enemys so that they will patrol an area instead of attack straight away. 

The Game turned out to be similar to Enter the Gungeon, there were many concepts left out of the game such as the 6 shot mechanic. I also think that i could have gotten the shooting enemys to work with more time.
