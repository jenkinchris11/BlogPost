### Game Information
In a city that made it their goal to forget the past and look towards the future, mysterious figures and factions have invaded a futuristic, sci-fi world. You – a rookie operator – must deal with these threats by any means necessary. The stages are as follows:

- VIKINGS – Large amounts of enemies means good positioning and AoE shots are needed.
- SAMURAI – Enemies move quickly and dodge often. High accuracy and skill is required.
- EGYPTIANS – A high amount of projectiles can make this area quite the bullet hell. Keep your dodge game strong!
- ROMANS – Enemies here are smarter than most and form tough formations. Use your knowledge of bullet types to win!

Blast enemies away in a 2.5D, top-down shooter, within a world mixed with both sci-fi and historical elements.
Low-poly artstyle with vibrant & colourful palate, complete with a non-serious tone suitable for most ages. 
Simple controls (shoot, slide, and move) that are easy to learn but hard to master, with a moderate difficulty curve. That are as follows:


Left Mouse = Shoot
Left Shift = Dash

W = Up
A = Left
S =	Down
D =	Right

Esc/P =	Pause
U =	Back to hub

### Chris Jenkin
My name is Chris and in this project i worked on Enemys and Enemy AI.

In this Project i contributed by creating the enemys and the enemy AI and making them have the proper animations for death, attack and walking. I also created a patrol for the enemys so that they will patrol an area instead of attack straight away. 

The Game turned out to be similar to Enter the Gungeon, there were many concepts left out of the game such as the 6 shot mechanic. I also think that i could have gotten the shooting enemys to work with more time.

### Arturs Zingis
My name is Arturs Zingis and during my time working on BlastBack, I have mainly focused on the shooting aspect of the game as well as a dashing mechanic but let us focus on the shooting as it is the more important one of the two. As we took a lot of inspiration from Enter the Gungeon and Furi, the shooting component was crucial to the game as I put on my heaviest programming boots and a winter jacket to survive cold debug errors to hopefully develop a smooth projectile firing mechanism.

I feel that this mechanic can make or break a game within this genre especially as each bullet hell game has distinct shooting mechanics or a twist on the classic method. This project came in-between as throughout the development, I did try to implement other shot types such as Fire/Ice to have different projectile types to juice the game up but in the end, both mechanics ended up being scrapped due to time constraints and so did my ability to work on the two. This took a bit of accepting to do as I was disappointed that they didn’t make it in the game, but I did struggle with actual implementation of the two shot types as there was seemingly no way to do them, no matter how much research I did. 

The inner workings of this blueprint include:
1.	When the LMB is clicked
2.	Perform “Camera Shake” which will open the gate for the bullet to be spawned.
3.	Add a short delay.
4.	Spawn the Bullet.

All the nodes that are underneath, state the location of the projectile spawn by addressing actors location and linking that to the pawn itself.
